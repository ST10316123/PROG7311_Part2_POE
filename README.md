}
```

**Save changes therafter



### 5. Ensure the ffg lines are uncommented in the program.cs file
```bash

using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
    var userManager = services.GetRequiredService<UserManager<ApplicationUser>>();
    var roleManager = services.GetRequiredService<RoleManager<IdentityRole>>();
    var context = services.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();
    var env = services.GetRequiredService<IWebHostEnvironment>();

    // Call the seeders to add the data
    await EmployeeSeeder.SeedAsync(userManager, roleManager);
    await FarmerSeeder.SeedAsync(userManager, roleManager);
    await ProductSeeder.SeedAsync(context, userManager, env);
}

```
**Save all changes and thereafter run the ffg command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run

```
